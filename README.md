# Unexpected Behavior with 0 and NaN in Conditional Statement

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function that involves handling the numbers 0 and NaN.  The function is intended to return 0 only when the input is null or undefined, however it currently also returns 0 for a numeric input of 0 and does not properly handle NaN values.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function uses a loose comparison (`==`) to check if the input `x` is null. This causes unexpected behavior because `0 == null` evaluates to `false` meaning `0` will be treated the same as `null` and `undefined`.

The function also fails to explicitly handle `NaN`, leading to `NaN` being returned instead of a more appropriate value such as 0 or an error.

## Solution

The solution improves the function by using strict equality (`===`) to check for null and undefined, and explicitly handles the case where the input is 0 or NaN, providing a more robust and predictable behavior.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to view the buggy code and `bugSolution.js` to view the corrected code.
3. Run the JavaScript files using Node.js or a similar environment.  Observe the output differences between the original buggy code and the corrected code.
